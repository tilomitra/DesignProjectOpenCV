/*
 *  These functions are used to parse basic command line options
 *  argc and argv are basic command line parameters
 *  i is the current scanning location in the command line
 *  opt is a string giving the option to look for in the command line
 *  additional parameters are option parameters that follow the
 *  option string.
 *
 *  Optional arguments should always be parsed before required arguments.
 *
 *  The functions are maid to be called within a four loop that inc i.
 *  If more that one argument is parsed i is updated to point at the last
 *  argument read to allow exicution to proceed normally on next loop.
 *
 *  Here is an example code illistrating how to parse command lines
 *  with this api:
 *
 *  int i; int num = 0;
 *
 *  Set up default values here.
 *
 *  for(i = 0; i < argc; i++){
 *      if      (readOption(argc, argv, &i, "-verbose"))                   { verbose = 1; }
 *      else if (readOptionInt(argc, argv, &i, "-debuglevel",&debuglevel)) {}
 *      else if (checkBadOption(argc, argv, &i))                           {}
 *      else if (readReqiredString(argc, argv, &i, &num, 0, filename))     {}
 *  }
 *
 *  then check to see if the correct number of required arguments were parsed
 *  if(num != 1){ clParseError(argc, argv, i, "Wrong number of command line arguments."); }
 *
 *  This code also expects that you have a useage function define that takes argv[0]
 *  as its only arguments and exits with value 1.
